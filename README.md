# Purdue Crypto Reading Group

The Purdue Crypto Reading Group focuses on exploring research papers and foundational topics in cryptography. We meet regularly to discuss recent advances, classic results, and open problems in the field. The goal is to foster a collaborative learning environment where participants can deepen their understanding of cryptography, exchange ideas, and stay updated on cutting-edge research.



## Getting Started

Getting started with Just the Class is simple.

1. Create a [new repository based on Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class/generate).
1. Update `_config.yml` and `README.md` with your course information. [Be sure to update the url and baseurl](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/site-url-baseurl/).
1. Configure a [publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages). Your course website is now live!
1. Edit and create `.md` [Markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to add more content pages.

Just the Class has been used by instructors at Stanford University ([CS 161](https://stanford-cs161.github.io/winter2021/)), UC Berkeley ([Data 100](https://ds100.org/fa21/)), UC Santa Barbara ([CSW8](https://ucsb-csw8.github.io/s22/)), Northeastern University ([CS4530/5500](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-CS5500-Spring-2021/)), and Carnegie Mellon University ([17-450/17-950](https://cmu-crafting-software.github.io/)). Share your course website and find more examples in the [show and tell discussion](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)!

### Local development environment

Just the Class requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler. To setup a local development environment, clone your template repository and follow the GitHub Docs on [Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
